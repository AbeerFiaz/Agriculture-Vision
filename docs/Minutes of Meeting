# Meeting 02 — Phase 2 Implementation

Meeting Date: 2025-02-10  
Members Present: All  
Phase: Phase 2 — Model Training & Initial Implementation  

1. Progress Since Last Meeting
- Repository structure created (/docs, /src, /data, /results)
- GitHub Project Board created and required members added
- Proposal uploaded to /docs/proposal
- Sample data files added to /data
- YOLOv8-n training pipeline drafted (src/yolo_training.py)
- SEN12MS NDVI/VARI extraction script started

2. New Tasks Assigned
1. | Complete YOLOv8-n training on PlantVillage | Sufyan | 1 week |
2. | Finish NDVI/VARI computation script using SEN12MS | Sufyan | 1 week |
3. | Jetson Nano setup (JetPack, CUDA, PyTorch, OpenCV) | AbuBaker + Ahmed Rafiq | 4–5 days |
4. | Prepare /results folder and add placeholders for Phase 2 outputs | Abeer | 3 days |
5. | Maintain /docs (meeting minutes, logbook updates) | Abeer | Ongoing |


3. Issues / Blockers
- SEN12MS dataset is too large — selective download method required  
- Jetson Nano needs compatible JetPack version  
- Need to finalize whether TensorRT conversion uses FP16 or INT8  


4. Decisions Made
- YOLOv8-n selected due to best performance on Jetson Nano  
- NDVI estimator will start with RGB→NDVI regression and VARI baseline  
- Jetson Nano responsibilities to be shared between **AbuBaker & Ahmed**  
- Initial results (graphs, screenshots, logs) will be pushed to /results  


5. Goals for Next Week
- Finish first YOLOv8-n training run  
- Generate sample NDVI-vs-ground-truth comparison  
- Validate Jetson Nano GPU acceleration + FPS benchmark
