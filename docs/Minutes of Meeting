# Meeting 02 — Phase 2 Implementation

Meeting Date: 2025-02-10  
Members Present: All  
Phase: Phase 2 — Model Training & Initial Implementation  

1. Progress Since Last Meeting
- Repository structure created (/docs, /src, /data, /results)
- GitHub Project Board created and required members added
- Proposal uploaded to /docs/proposal
- Sample data files added to /data
- YOLOv8-n training pipeline drafted (src/yolo_training.py)
- SEN12MS NDVI/VARI extraction script started

 | Task                                                             | Assigned To            | Time Allotted |
 | Complete YOLOv8-n training on PlantVillage                       | Sufyan                 | 1 week |
 | Finish NDVI/VARI computation script using SEN12MS                | Sufyan                 | 1 week |
 | Jetson Nano setup (JetPack, CUDA, PyTorch, OpenCV)               | AbuBaker + Ahmed Rafiq | 4–5 days |
 | Prepare /results folder and add placeholders for Phase 2 outputs | Abeer                  | 3 days |
 | Maintain /docs (meeting minutes, logbook updates)                | Abeer                  | Ongoing |


3. Issues / Blockers
- SEN12MS dataset is too large — selective download method required  
- Jetson Nano needs compatible JetPack version  
- Need to finalize whether TensorRT conversion uses FP16 or INT8  


4. Decisions Made
- YOLOv8-n selected due to best performance on Jetson Nano  
- NDVI estimator will start with RGB→NDVI regression and VARI baseline  
- Jetson Nano responsibilities to be shared between **AbuBaker & Ahmed**  
- Initial results (graphs, screenshots, logs) will be pushed to /results  


5. Goals for Next Week
- Finish first YOLOv8-n training run  
- Generate sample NDVI-vs-ground-truth comparison  
- Validate Jetson Nano GPU acceleration + FPS benchmark

# Minutes of Meeting — Phase 3

Phase: Phase 3 — Training, Testing & Deployment  
Meeting No.: 3  
Date: 12-11-2025
Mode: In-person / Online  

## Attendees
- Abeer  
- Sufyan  
- AbuBakar  
- Ahmed Rafiq  


## Agenda
1. Review progress from Phase 2  
2. Plan Phase 3 implementation tasks  
3. Assign responsibilities for training, testing, and deployment  
4. Define expected outputs for Phase 3

## Discussion Summary

- Phase 2 tasks were reviewed and confirmed as completed, including repository setup, baseline NDVI work, and initial YOLO script drafting.
- It was agreed that Phase 3 will focus on **full-scale model training**, **NDVI/VARI evaluation**, and **Jetson Nano deployment**.
- YOLOv8-n will be trained on the complete PlantVillage dataset and evaluated using accuracy and loss metrics.
- NDVI and VARI outputs will be tested on SEN12MS samples and compared against ground truth NDVI.
- Jetson Nano setup will be completed, followed by real-time inference testing and FPS measurement.
- Results such as plots, graphs, and performance logs will be documented and stored in the `/results` directory.


## Decisions Made

- YOLOv8-n selected as the final detection model for deployment.
- RGB-based NDVI/VARI estimation to be used instead of multispectral hardware.
- TensorRT optimization will be applied for Jetson Nano inference.
- Phase 3 results will include both quantitative metrics and visual outputs.
