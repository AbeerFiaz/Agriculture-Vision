Among the reviewed works, three papers form the foundation of this project:

1. Wang et al. (2022), which guides the YOLO-based implementation for plant disease detection; 
2. Chiu et al. (2020), serving as the key survey and dataset reference through the Agriculture-Vision benchmark; and 
3. Sheng et al. (2020), representing the state-of-the-art approach by integrating vegetation indices with deep-learning models for agricultural analysis.
